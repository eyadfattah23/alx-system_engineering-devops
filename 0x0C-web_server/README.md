> S.N. Method and Description

    1 GET

    The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.

    2 HEAD

    Same as GET, but transfers the status line and header section only.

    3 POST

    A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.

    4 PUT

    Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.

    5 DELETE

    Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI.

    6 CONNECT

    Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by a given URI.

    7 OPTIONS

    Describes the communication options for the target resource.

    8 TRACE

    Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.

```bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-transfer_file
Usage: 0-transfer_file PATH_TO_FILE IP USERNAME PATH_TO_SSH_KEY
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ ssh ubuntu@8.8.8.8 -i /vagrant/sylvain 'ls ~/'
afile
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ touch some_page.html
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-transfer_file some_page.html 8.8.8.8 sylvain /vagrant/private_key
some_page.html                                     100%   12     0.1KB/s   00:00
sylvain@ubuntu$ ssh ubuntu@8.8.8.8 -i /vagrant/private_key 'ls ~/'
afile
some_page.html
sylvain@ubuntu$
```

In this example, I:

    remotely execute the ls ~/ command via ssh to see what ~/ contains
    create a file named some_page.html
    execute my 0-transfer_file script
    remotely execute the ls ~/ command via ssh to see that the file some_page.html has been successfully transferred

**Maartenâ€™s PRO-tip:** When you use sudo su on your web-01 you can become root like this to test your file:

```bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ sudo su
root@ubuntu#
```

To configure your DNS records with an A (Address) entry to point your root domain to the IP address of your web server (web-01), you'll need to do the following:

    Access Your DNS Provider:
    Log in to the website of your DNS hosting provider. This is typically the service where you purchased your domain.

    Locate DNS Management or DNS Settings:
    Look for a section called "DNS Management," "DNS Settings," or something similar. This is where you can configure your domain's DNS records.

    Find the A Record Section:
    Locate the section for A (Address) records. This is where you can map your domain to an IP address.

    Add or Edit the A Record:

        If there is an existing A record for your domain, edit it to set the IP address to your web server (web-01).

        If there isn't an A record, add a new one. The A record should look something like this:

        Type: A
        Name: @ (represents the root domain)
        Value: IP Address of web-01


    If your DNS provider requires a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the "Name" field, you can use your root domain (e.g., example.com) instead of @.

    Save Changes:
    Save your changes. DNS changes may take some time to propagate across the internet, so it might not take effect immediately.

Here's a simple example:

    Type: A
    Name: @ (or your root domain if required)
    Value: IP Address of web-01

Remember that DNS changes can take some time to propagate, and during this period, users might still see the old information cached by their ISPs or browsers.
